# Solve-Quadratic-and-first-level--equations
My first repository on GitHub

The file RunRealsComplexRoots.py will solve any equation a*xÂ²+b*x+c = 0 or a*x + b = 0. When run the file RunRealsComplexRoots.py provide new values to the coefficients: a= ?, b = ? and c = ?. To solve equations of the first level do the coefficients: a = 0 or c = 0 when run the file RunRealsComplexRoots.py.
